## Hi there, we are the Segel Lab!!

We are a new lab located in the Department of [Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology](https://hscrb.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)

We are interested in all things development and aging, with a particular focus on the brain. 

Interested in collaborating or coming to work with us? Please reach out!

Check out some of our work:
1. [Myc determines the functional age state of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00109-4)
2. [Mammalian retrovirus-like protein PEG10 packages its own mRNA and can be pseudotyped for mRNA delivery](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.abg6155)
3. [Niche stiffness underlies the ageing of central nervous system progenitor cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1484-9)
